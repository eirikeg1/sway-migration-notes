# Overview
Best screenshot experience on Fedora/Sway is 
with three specialized command line tools: Grim, Slurp, and Swappy.

* Grim: Grabs the image (equivalent to the "Print Screen" function).

* Slurp: Lets you draw a rectangle on the screen to select an area.

* Swappy: A lightweight Wayland-native editor (similar to the Windows Snipping Tool editor) to crop, draw arrows, blur text, and save.
