## Initial thoughts
* UK keyboard
* Mouse doesn't move with keyboard controls when focusing windows, but windows-focus goes after mouse. This makes it so that you need to move the mouse for it to not focus back the previous windows after a few seconds

## Issues
* Serious mouse bug - randomly not interactive with certain windows
